I have built a real estate price prediction model/server in this data science project.
Firstly I have built a model using sklearn and linear regression using the Banglore_home_prices dataset from kaggle.com
The second step would be to write a Python flask server that uses the saved model to serve HTTP requests.
The third component is the website built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to enter square ft the area, bedrooms, etc. of the property.
I have used techniques like - data cleaning, outlier detection, and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k-fold cross-validation etc.

Technologies/Concepts used :
1. Python (3.10)
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter Notebook, visual studio code as IDE
6. Python flask for HTTP server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI and functionality

We can further deploy this website to the cloud as a future improvement.
